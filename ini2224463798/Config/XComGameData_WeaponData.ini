;Implant amps copy all the same values used as normal psiamps except for the following

;========================================================================================================================================

;these values are given to 'implant' psi amps... the one from this mod, sectoid psi amps from playable aliens and biotic psi amps
;all other attributes of the 'implant' amps from this mod use the exact same values from base game amps
;sectoid and biotic get only the adjusted slots and imagery, see their respective mods for other values
;default is set as ' 2 behind' slots of 'external' amps from the pexm3 mod ... 
  ;CV default 0  pexm_cv 2       ; MG default 1  pexm_mg 3       ;BM default 2  pexm_bm 4

;========================================================================================================================================

;setting the below value to true, will follow the default game behaviour that the 'psiamp' is hidden from the armory until psionics research is done
;setting the below value to false, will make the 'implant' amps from this mod visible from the start
;the design intent for these psi amps is for them to be the 'low grade' free amp availiable in the world from day one

;what should the XCOM implant amp have as starting perks ?          (( DOES NOT AFFECT Sectoid Amp or Biotic Amp ))
;pexm3 default is setup for BonusStats and SyphonWill, for the will system, but the intended class users of implants are immune to the will system
;uncomment the extra lines here for pexm3 compatibility if you wanted the 'implant' amps from this mod to behave -exactly- like pexm3 amps
;changes to the base game amp stats (from the stats perk) will therefore also automatically affect the 'implant' amps from this mod
