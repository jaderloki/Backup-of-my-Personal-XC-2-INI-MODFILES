[XComGame.X2Item_DefaultGrenades]

; For reference:
; Weak cover objects (fences, trash cans, vending machines, some walls, etc.) require 10 environment damage to destroy
; Medium cover objects (some trees, most walls, etc.) require 20 environment damage to destroy
; Strong cover objects (train walls, most trees, etc.) require 30 environment damage to destroy
; The above is in general. Some objects are less/more sturdy than they may appear.
; To destory something, all damage must be dealt in one effect. Environment health is effectively 'reset' after every action

; Uncomment the following two lines to have Frag Grenades behave like LW2 in regards to environment damage
;-FragGrenade_iEnvironmentDamage = 10
;+FragGrenade_iEnvironmentDamage = 9

;-ALIENGRENADE_IENVIRONMENTDAMAGE=20

; Swap the comments for the following two lines to have Alien Grenades behave like LW2 in regards to environment damage
+ALIENGRENADE_IENVIRONMENTDAMAGE= 10
;+ALIENGRENADE_IENVIRONMENTDAMAGE= 9

[WOTC_LW2SecondaryWeapons.X2Item_LWGauntlet]
; Uncomment the following lines to have the Gauntlet Rockets (from [WOTC] LW2 Secondary Weapons) behave more closely to LW2
; NOTE: Requires that this mod is loaded AFTER [WOTC] LW2 Secondary Weapons
; NOTE: If this still doesn't work, it's because XCOM 2 does not always load mods in a predictable order. In that case, you must change the values in that mod's config file
