;BLEEDOUT_ROLL=100
;mod rolls this against a soldier's will. if it's lower, they live, if it's higher, they die.

; Original bleedout configuration uses the equivalent to a DC roll to see if the unit dies or not.
; The formula is Random(Roll) > Current Will then the MOCX unit dies.
; This mirrors the way XCOM enters bleedout, but the problem is that enemies don't experience Will loss the same way.
; Meaning that values less than 60 or 70 can essentially become "MOCX always enters bleedout".

; This Alternate Bleedout formula is Random(100) > (Base Bleedout Chance * (1.0 + (Current Will / 100))) then the MOCX unit dies.
; This keeps in the spirit of the bleedout mechanic, where there is a baseline chance to survive based upon the MOCX unit's will
; and allows the bleedout chance to scale with higher level soldiers (which was something that base MOCX already desired.)
; The big difference, is it gives more meaning to the number supplies by the user and keeps the chances much more consistent.
