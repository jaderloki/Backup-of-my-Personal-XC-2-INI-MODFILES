;default mods position is 126, 222  : bottom center
BondIconX = 126

;this is how wide the STATUS text field should be.
;212 is the largest acceptable before overlapping the DAYS text
;luckily that is just big enough to make Gravely Wounded not scroll
;default game size is roughly 185
TextWidth = 212

;this setting disables the promote button for Rookies on the After Action Report
;this is useful for mods like Choose My Class, Commanders Choice and Custom SPARK Classes
;which all require a CHL hook from the Armoury to do special things with Rookies on promotion
;if you set this false, those mods may still disable the button, BUT ONLY for units in the front row
;so setting it true here just helps to bring some consistency
;and means all those separate mods do not need updates to account for this mods new row
bDisablePromoteForRookie = true

;bond flyovers for the squad normally popup in pairs
;this is actually really disorientating for 6+ units, with pairs split across two rows
;or if a unit has bonds avaliable with units not even in the squad!
;we can click the bond icon right here on the AAR screen for more info, so all we really need to know is a unit has bonds ready
;setting this false makes all bond flyovers pop at the same time, much less confusion imo
;setting this true will restore base game pairs functionality
bBondFlyoversAreSequential = false

;config array mod-added After action flyovers -- see readme notes
;defaults here are for the 3 normal game flyovers (NewBonds, BestPair, Will) , and I couple I thought to add
