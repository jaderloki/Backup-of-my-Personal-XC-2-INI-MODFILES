[RWRealisticNonInstantaneousConstructions.RWRealisticNonInstantaneousConstructions]
;My Shen doesn't "magically" pop out Items in an instant (out of her Mary Poppins bag???) but building them realistically takes time (proportionally to their Tech level) and, when she's not busy building Items (in one of my 2 Engineer Slots of her Engineering Workshop), she can be assigned as an Engineer elsewhere, yours?

;Doesn't it bother you that, while those poor guys in Proving Ground sweat for weeks for a stupid Skulljack, Shen instead instantly pulls stuff out of her magic hat as Firaxis unrealistically intended? Well, I couldn't stand it anymore and literally couldn't continue my Campaign until I modded this absurdity out of existence once and for all... No more magic tricks, Dr.Shen... ;)

;YOU CAN CHANGE THE VALUES (EXPLAINED BELOW) TO THE DESIRED ONES FROM THE .INI FILE 
;and pleeeeease don't you dare asking where the .ini file is... seriously? ;) 

;AUTOGENERATE CONSTRUCTION TIME
DaysToBuild	= 1 
ExtraDaysToBuildForEachTier	= 1 
;For example, a Tier 3 Item will take 1 + 3 days... (You can also select fractions of a day...)

;CHOOSE CLASSIFICATION TYPE
IPreferAdditionalBuildingTimeBasedOn6TiersInsteadOfOn3Tiers = true
;You can base it upon 3 Tiers (Conventional/Magnetic/Beam Kevlar/Plated/Powered) but also upon a 6-Tier Classification. In fact I realized that XCom2 Code has a hidden classification of 6 Tiers which is used by Firaxis as a better internal classification system to: order items shown in menus, to choose best item to autoequip, etc...

;WEAPONS
;Tier 0 CONVENTIONAL(ALL)	FLASH/SMOKE GRENADES	
;Tier 1	FLASH/SMOKE BOMBS EXPERIMENTAL GRENADES(10DAYS) 
;Tier 2 MAGNETIC(RIFLE/SECONDARY)	PLASMA GRENADE	EXPERIMENTAL BOMBS (10DAYS)
;Tier 3 MAGNETIC(SHOTGUN/CANNON/SNIPER)	
;Tier 4 BEAM(RIFLE/SECONDARY)	
;Tier 5 BEAM(SHOTGUN/CANNON/SNIPER)	
;(My Mini-Mod "RW Better Coil Laser Plasma Tiers Integration" correctly integrates Coil/Laser/Plasma Weapons into this Tier Classification in a linear increment for a correctly linear Construction Times generation... ;)

;ARMORS
;Tier 0 KEVLAR	NANOFIBERVEST
;Tier 1 PLATED
;Tier 2 EXO/SPIDER(7DAYS)	
;Tier 3 POWERED	
;Tier 4 WRATH/WAR(10DAYS)	
;(The ones from Proving Grounds already had Construction Time obviously)	

;UTILITIES
;Tier 0 MEDIKIT	
;Tier 1	NANOMEDIKIT/BATTLESCANNER/MIMICBEACON/MINDSHIELD
;Tier 2 COMBATSTIMS	

;HIGHEST DIFFICULTY
IAlsoPreferLegendaryDifficultyToIncreaseConstructionTimeByFiftyPercent = true
;In Default-XCom2 all Proving Ground Construction Times are always increased by 50% in highest Difficulty (similar highest Difficulty Time increase exists for all Tygan Researches, Facility Constructions, Room Clearings, etc...). It feels appropriate to me to apply the same increase in Shen's Engineering Constructions...

;HOURS OR DAYS?
AmountOfDaysBelowWhichToShowConstructionTimeInHours = 3
;For a clearer description of the correct Construction Times of Low Tier Items (when 2 Engineers are assigned to them): 12hours, 36hours, etc... ;)

;SPARK REPAIR
;Assigning a Spark in the usual Repair Spark Slot will create a repair order put in the "construction line" with the rest of the Items and, as any order, it will be taken care of "only if" you place it as the first in line (similarly as in Proving Ground Projects)... ;)

;DIFFICULTY BALANCE
;In order to preserve the Difficulty Balance originally intended by Firaxis, the disadvantage of these new construction waiting times had to be compensated somehow. In my opinion the advantage of adding Shen as 1 extra assignable Engineer from the start not only elegantly compensates by letting her help in other jobs while not busy building items, but it is also realistic (what the hell was she doing before standing there all day like an idiot?). AAdditionally, the realistic disadvantage of Spark Repair now having to "compete" to be "first in line" amongst other Engineering Constructions, is elegantly compensated by the advantage of being able to double the repair speed by assigning a second Engineer (as for any other Engineering Construction)... ;)

;SUGGESTED MINI-MODS COMBOS
; "Realistic Non-Instantaneous Constructions" and "Realistic Non-Infinite Constructions" are perfect brothers. In fact they originally were one single Mini-Mod ("Realistic Constructions") but then decided to split them apart for debugging reasons (faster to switch them off separately to find bug), for politeness reasons (didn't want to throw to many options on your faces, guys) but mainly for didactical reasons (another good programming exercise for my personal XCom Programmimg Home-School)... ;)

;FIRST MEDIKIT
;Obviously during Tutorial days this Mini-Mod will automatically keep itself turned off so that the first Medikit will instantaneously come magically out of Shen's sleeve otherwise you would be stuck when Bradford expects you to equip it during the second mission... ;)
