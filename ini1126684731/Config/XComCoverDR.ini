[CoverDamageReduction_WOTC.CoverDR_Impl]
; Configure DR values for cover here.
; Fractional values are supported and give probabilistic DR (0.5 = 50% chance of 1 DR)
HALFCOVER_DMG_REDUCTION=0.33
FULLCOVER_DMG_REDUCTION=1.0

; These multiply the incoming damage and add to flat DR.  Default is 0 (no proportional DR).  1 would absorb all damage.
HALFCOVER_DMG_REDUCTION_MULT=0.0
FULLCOVER_DMG_REDUCTION_MULT=0.0

; These can be used to cap the DR when the above values are set.
; for those who don't want to see a cactus absorb an entire sectopod cannon blast.
HALFCOVER_DMG_REDUCTION_MAX=2.0
FULLCOVER_DMG_REDUCTION_MAX=5.0

; Whether to use damage reduction for explosives such as grenades.
; Does not apply to grenades without environmental damage such as Gas grenades
EXPLOSIVE_DMG_REDUCTION = true

; Whether to use the cover between the explosion center and the target to determine DR (as opposed to LW1 style)
USE_EXPLOSION_LOCATION = true
