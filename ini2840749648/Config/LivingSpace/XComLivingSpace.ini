;Squad size has been increased by between 33% (6 man squads up to 8 man squads) and 50% (infiltrations going from 4 to 6).
;Vanilla values are 30/40/50 for Living Space. The number must be increased, but it should still be restrictive.
;I'm going to be rounding off a 33% increase, which should end up with a slightly more restrictive total living space.
;30*1.33=39.9 ,40*1.33=53.2, 50*1.33=66.5
;Final Values: 40 > 55 > 65 up from 30 > 40 > 50
