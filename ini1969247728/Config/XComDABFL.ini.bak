; Log what this mod is doing, will spawm a bit but is useful to leave on if you happen across odd behaviour.
; I highly recommend using Skirmish Mode+ to easily test your configuration.
; https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1535761480
bLogging=true
; Log even more what is going on under the hood, needs logging set to true.
; This is mostly for me as a development aid.
bVerbose=false

; Should this mod roll for more enemies for pods that only contain a single unit.
; Does affect the rulers and does not affect the chosen.
bAffectSingleUnits=false

; Should this mod also process reinforcement spawns.
; There is a separate list for reinforcement rules.
bAffectReinforcements=true

; Should this mod also process the Lost spawns.
; There is a separate list for the Lost rules.
bAffectTheLost=false

; Should this mod ignore the ForceSpawnTemplateNames set on an encounter.
; By default the forced spawns are kept and rules are rolled to possibly add new followers.
; Enable to ignore the forced followers and always reroll everything.
; There aren't many forced spawns in the base game but some mods use them to make themed pods.
bIgnoreForcedSpawnNames=false

; Should this mod ignore MaxCharactersPerGroup set in the encounter lists.
; This should only be used if you want to increase pod sizes A LOT (+10, +20 lot) and not tweak the encounter lists by hand.
; Enable to allow any number of duplicate followers in a single pod.
bIgnoreMaxCharactersPerGroup=false

; Should this mod ingnore the supported followers list on character templates.
; Enable to allow any follower to be added under any leader. (FL and other restrictions still apply as usual)
; This will make pods contain random grab bags of units. Finding specific corpses for autopsies may become unnecessarily hard.
bIgnoreSupportedFollowers=false

; Should this mod use a merged sitrep encounter list rather than an overriding one.
; By default, the default encounter list is merged with the sitrep list to allow for a lot better mod support at the cost of a little less themed pods.
; Sitrep specific lists have by convention much higher spawn weights so enemies added from there are much more likely to be picked as followers.
; If the leader has no supported sitrep specific followers the default ones are stll present and can be used to fill the pod.
; If multiple sitreps are present ALL of the lists are merged for maximum support. This can only happen with other mods that add more sitreps.
; Disable to use base XCOM 2 behaviour where pods spawn with just the leader if there are no valid followers in the sitrep list.
bMergeSitrepLists=true

; How much variance should be added to the follower force levels.
; This can smooth difficulty spikes caused by all of the troopers (or any other units) upgrading from basic to advanced to elites overnight.
; iMinForceLevel dictates when (if) this feature becomes active.
; iPositive allows followers from that many force level higher to be selected.
; iNegative controls the opposite: how long to keep the lower force level units available.
; USE A POSITIVE VALUE FOR BOTH, failing to do so may lead to no followers at all!
ForceLevelVariance=(iMinForceLevel=0, iPositive=0, iNegative=0)
; e.g. setting positive to 0 and negative to 3 would allow a FL 10 encounter to roll followers from FL 7 to 10, this smooths out the difficulty spikes.
; e.g. setting both to 2 would allow a FL 10 encounter to roll followers from FL 8 to 12
; In my opinion a somewhat balanced setup would be along the lines of: min=5 +1 -2

; Should this mod and how much to favour adding duplicate units in a pod based on what enemies are already selected.
; With a lot of enemy mods the pod composition usually ends up quite random i.e. there are rarely more than one of a single unit if there is ample choice for followers.
; Setting this option will make pods a bit more themed by adding more of the same on average while still keeping the initial randomness.
fDuplicateUnitFavourFactor=-1.0
; Values above 1.0 will make duplicates more common and values between 0.0 - 1.0 will make duplicates more rare.
; SpawnWeight after adjustment = (old weight) * (this factor), this means the same unit can get adjusted multiple times.
; Values below 0 are considered invalid.
; This does not change the maximum number of a given type of enemy in a pod, that is set in the encounter lists.
; The adjusted spawn weights do not carry over from one pod to another, so the first unit selected is always as random as with this feature off.


; --- MISSION AND SITREP MODIFIERS ---

; These modifiers are used to better balance this mod on specific missions and sitreps.

; format:
;+MissionModifiers=(TargetName="SabotageAdventMonument", bExclusion=false, iMaxEnemiesInPod=3, iForceLevelOffset=-2)

; 'TargetName' specifies the mission or sitrep this modifier affects.
; 'bExclusion' true/false, is used to disable this mod on any specific mission or sitrep
; 'iMaxEnemiesInPod' is used to limit the maximum number of enemies a single pod can have.
; 'iForceLevelOffset' is used to adjust the force level of followers added by this mod.
; 'iEnemyCountOffset' is used to adjust the number of enemies this mod tries to add to each pod, it works both ways. iMaxEnemiesInPod limitations still apply.
; Unspecified values default to 0.
; Mission and sitrep modifiers are separated into 2 different arrays: "MissionModifiers" and "SitRepModifiers", be sure to add to the correct one!
; Only the first entry with a given 'TargetName' is ever used, no duplicates!

; Disabled on tutorial / MP

+MissionModifiers=(TargetName="ChosenShowdown_Warlock",  bExclusion=true)
+MissionModifiers=(TargetName="ChosenShowdown_Hunter",   bExclusion=true)

; Balancing for the more extreme sitreps. These are my personal preferences, tweak to your heart's content.
+SitRepModifiers=(TargetName="Fireteam",   bExclusion=false, iMaxEnemiesInPod=2, iForceLevelOffset=-4) ; squad of 2 soldiers
+SitRepModifiers=(TargetName="Surgical",   bExclusion=false, iMaxEnemiesInPod=3) ; squad of 3 soldiers
+SitRepModifiers=(TargetName="LowProfile", bExclusion=false, iEnemyCountOffset=-1) ; only ranks sergeant or lower
+SitRepModifiers=(TargetName="Advanced",   bExclusion=false, iMaxEnemiesInPod=2) ; Advanced gives +6 to enemy force level

; Both mission and sitrep modifiers can take effect at the same time:
; Lowest enemy limit is used and the force level offsets are combined.


; --- POD SIZE INCREASE RULES ---

; The bread and butter of this mod; add more enemies to pods based on user configurable rules.

; format:
;+AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=1, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=100, iNumToAdd=5, iForceLevelOffset=5)

; 'iMinForceLevel' is the minimum force level for this rule to be rolled.
; 'iMaxForceLevel' is the maximum force level for this rule to be rolled.
; 'iChance' is a percentage value how likely this rule succeeds.
; 'iNumToAdd' is the number of enemies this rule adds if it succeeds.
; 'iForceLevelOffset' is used to adjust the force level of followers added by the rule.
; Unspecified values default to 0.
; The rules are independent of each other, and are rolled in the order they appear here.

; By default, every 5 force levels adds an additional coin flip for +1 enemy in each pod.
+AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=5,  iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=1)
+AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=10, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=1)
+AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=15, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=1)
+AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=20, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=1)
; This results in no additional enemies until FL5, and up to +4 per pod at FL20.

; For a guaranteed increase, set iChance >= 100.
;+AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=1, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=100, iNumToAdd=5, iForceLevelOffset=0)

; If you want duplicate rules, you should use '.' instead of '+'
;.AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=1, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=100, iNumToAdd=1)

;.AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=1, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=100, iNumToAdd=1)

; Use the force level offset to roll followers from a lower / higher force level, e.g. create a swarm of less powerful units
;+AlienPodSizeRules=(iMinForceLevel=1, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=100, iNumToAdd=5, iForceLevelOffset=-5)

; Reinforcements rules are only rolled for reinforcement pods.
; By default we add at maximum 3 units to each reinforcement pod, with a similar pacing as for regular pods.
+ReinforcementRules=(iMinForceLevel=5,  iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=1)
+ReinforcementRules=(iMinForceLevel=10, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=1)
+ReinforcementRules=(iMinForceLevel=15, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=1)

; The Lost use a single set of rules that affects both initial spawns and reinforcements.
+TheLostRules=(iMinForceLevel=5,  iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=2)
+TheLostRules=(iMinForceLevel=10, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=2)
+TheLostRules=(iMinForceLevel=15, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=2)
+TheLostRules=(iMinForceLevel=20, iMaxForceLevel=20, iChance=50, iNumToAdd=2)


; Extra compatibility things mainly for mods that do special things using the same hook this mod uses.
; You can use these to disable this mod based on other things, but you most likely never need to.
; Currently MOCX is the only mod I know of that needs this special compatibility.

; Encounters listed here won't be processed by this mod.
; This check is not exact; it matches partial names so no need to specify mocx_teamx3 x4 x5... separately.
