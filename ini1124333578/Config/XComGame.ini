; Array (so use .AbilityTemplate_SkipProvidedDamagePreviewFunction to add extra items)
; for those abilities that want to do initial damage preview (the kind you see in the text field
; next to your ability bar) separate from per-target damage preview.  For instance, 
; CapacitorDischarge makes this damage function ignore robots so that it makes sure to only
; display base damage, and doesn't accidentally make you think it will do robot damage to non-robots
AbilityTemplate_SkipProvidedDamagePreviewFunction=CapacitorDischarge

; Array (so use .AbilityTemplate_UseMultiStageAbility to add extra items)
; for those abilities which don't do damage initially but will do damage next turn, if you want
; to preview the damage they'll do at that time.  Damage preview will replace using the first
; ability template(in the pair) with the second
AbilityTemplate_UseMultiStageAbility=( InitialStageName=WrathCannonStage1, SecondaryStageName=WrathCannonStage2 )
.AbilityTemplate_UseMultiStageAbility=( InitialStageName=PsiBombStage1, SecondaryStageName=PsiBombStage2 )


; Array (so use .AbilityTemplate_NonTargetedSelfBasedAOE to add extra items)
; for those abilities which don't have a targeting method that provides a list of targeted actors,
; but are self-based AoE effects (like Sectopod Lightning Field)
AbilityTemplate_NonTargetedSelfBasedAOE=SectopodLightningField
.AbilityTemplate_NonTargetedSelfBasedAOE=Nova

; Array (so use .AbilityTemplate_ForceDeadEyeArmorReduction to add extra items)
; for those abilities which are "deadeye" targeting (which the UI interprets as ignoring armor)
; but for which armor must take effect.
AbilityTemplate_ForceDeadEyeArmorReduction=bombard
.AbilityTemplate_ForceDeadEyeArmorReduction=Fuse
.AbilityTemplate_ForceDeadEyeArmorReduction=ThrowShrapnel
.AbilityTemplate_ForceDeadEyeArmorReduction=ThrowClaymore
