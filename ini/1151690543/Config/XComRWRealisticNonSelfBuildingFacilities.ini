[RWRealisticNonSelfBuildingFacilities.RWRealisticNonSelfBuildingFacilities]
;My Facilities don't magically "build themselves up" when no Engineer is assigned but instead their construction realistically doesn't progress (exactly like for Rooms Debris Clearings) and, as a consequence, my Facilities Constructions have a second Engineer-Slot (also exactly like for Rooms Debris Clearings) to reduce Construction Time by 50% (and, to compensate the extra work, from the beginning of the Campaign Shen counts as an extra assignable Engineer), yours?

;BUILDING FACILITY BEFORE THIS MINI-MOD
;0 Engineers --> Building
;1 Engineer  --> 50% Time Reduction

;BUILDING FACILITY WITH THIS MINI-MOD (EXACTLY LIKE FOR CLEARING ROOM-DEBRIS)
;0 Engineers --> Paused
;1 Engineer  --> Building
;2 Engineers --> 50% Time Reduction

;I COULDN'T STAND IT
;I know that there is other Crew in the Avenger besides Engineers, Scientists and Soldiers (the ones with gray suit) but, as a mechanical engineer myself, I simply can't stand the fact that a Spaceship Facility could be entirely built without (at least the constant supervision of) a single Engineer... but apart from that, why Rooms Debris Clearings need at least an assigned Engineer to progress while Facilities Constructions don't??? I couldn't stand the incoherence... I simply couldn't continue my Campaign until I modded this inconsistence out of existence once and for all... ;)

;DIFFICULTY BALANCE
;To preserve the difficulty balance originally intended by Firaxis this disadvantage of Facilities Constructions not progressing anymore without at least one assigned Engineer had to be compensated somehow. It felt not only an appropriate balance but also an elegantly realistic one to allow let Shen be an extra assignable Engineer from the beginning of the Campaign (what the hell was she doing standing there like an idiot all day?).Neuroscientists"). 

;SAME FOR PROVING GROUND CONSTRUCTIONS?
;If you want the same dynamics for that you can do it with my other Mini-Mod "RW Realistic Non Self Building Proving Ground Tech"... ;)  I was originally planning to move both these modifications into a single Mini-Mod during the "mutilation" process of my RW Mega-Mod but then said... naah, what the heck, let's cut it into 2 separate Mini-Mods...
