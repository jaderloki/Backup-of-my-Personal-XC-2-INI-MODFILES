[MoreDarkEvents.X2EventListener_MoreDarkEvents]

;This mod allows the number of dark events to depend on current in game month, and on the current Doom (avatar pips).
;for each of them some logic is applied, and then the numbers are combined.
;For each of the numbers, you have two options: either specify explicitly the numbers, OR use a linear formula.
;NOTE: 1) if you use explicit numbers, the formula is ignored. If you get to a point that's not covered by your explicit numbers - the last entry will be used.
;NOTE: 2) Number of months counts "xcom 2 months" - i.e., supply drops, which normally are 21 days, and not 30 days.
;for example, the following will just increase the number by 1 every month.

;PerMonthFormulaSlope = 1.0
;PerMonthFormulaConstantTerm = 0.0;

;but to use it, you should nuke the array below. Since the array is specified, the formula is ignored. 
PerMonthDarkEvent[0] = 1
PerMonthDarkEvent[1] = 2
PerMonthDarkEvent[2] = 3
PerMonthDarkEvent[3] = 3
PerMonthDarkEvent[4] = 4
PerMonthDarkEvent[5] = 4
PerMonthDarkEvent[6] = 5

PerDoomFormulaSlope = 0.334
PerDoomFormulaConstantTerm = 0
;this will mean that for 0-2 avatar ticks - no DE are added, 3-5 - 1 is added, 6-8 - 2 are added, etc...
;OR - you can specify your own logic with the array:
;PerDoomDarkEvent[0] = 0

;and you can set a maximum.
MaxDarkEvents = 9999
;...no meaninful maximum is set by default.
