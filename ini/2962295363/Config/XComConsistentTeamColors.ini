;-----------------------------
; Optional: SitRep Overrides
;-----------------------------
; SitRep overrides can make specific factions different colors than the normal Team_Two (or Team_One) color
;  For example: you could make all Team Two encounters green, except for Bandit Raiders being tan, by setting TeamTwoColor to eUIState_Good
;  and setting the SitRepOverride for the SitRep "RaiderIncursion" to eUIState_Header
; SitRep overrides take effect even if the option to force the team color in general is set to false

; Blueprints for many mods below -- uncomment (remove the leading ";") and tweak the TeamColor as desired
;  Additional overrides can be added using the same format
