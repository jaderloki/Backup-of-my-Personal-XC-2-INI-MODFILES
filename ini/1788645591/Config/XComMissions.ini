;
; -------- GENERAL
; This will enable Chosen to spawn on mission. Experimental.
EnableChosenOnMission = false
; This will enable Lost to spawn on mission. Experimental.
EnableLostOnMission = false
; Enables the tutorial pop-ups. Recommended for first time players for this mission.
EnableTutorialPopups = true
; Since there are mods that can change the number of units in a pod, I had to externalize this value.
; Caps reinforcements until the mission has this number of enemies (Only alien side is determined)
RNFUnitCap = 0
; This determines the chance that additional RNF (with EncounterID OPNx2Strong) will appear alongside the standard Reinforcement pod: OPNx3_Standard.
; This is evaluated at the first of every turn once you free the prisoners.
RNFPodChance_OPNx2Strong = 0

; -------- EVAC
; Makes the mission a little more interesting. 
;
; Formula: Rand(2,4) + 2. 1 to 3 if we don't count the current turn.
;
; That determines the number of turns that it takes before EVAC arrives. 
; After 3 turns has passed after Evac has arrived, the Skyranger will depart. The die is rolled again + 2 turns.
; The mission will repeat this process until either everyone Evac'd or died.
;
; If disabled, spawn the Evac Zone after X turns and stay there permanently.
EnableSpecialRulesOnEVAC = true
; How many turns to add to the normal Evac timer. Works for both Normal and Special Rules.
TurnsUntilEVACArrivesModifier = 1
; How many turns to add to the number of turns before Evac must leave. Only works for Special Rules.
TurnsUntilEVACLeavesModifier = 50

; Version 1.120
; Allows you to customize where the Evac Zone is placed
; The Evac Zone takes in the current location of XCom's Centerpoint, then does some calcuations considering MinDistance, MaxDistance, and BiasAwayFromXComSpawn.
; Once this is all calculated, the final location of the Evac Zone is returned to the game, and is placed on the map.

; EvacZone_MinDistance:			  minimum distance from Team XCom's Centerpoint Location
; EvacZone_MaxDistance:			  maximum distance from Team XCom's Centerpoint Location
; EvacZone_BiasAwayFromXComSpawn: will attempt to pick a zone further from XCom's initial spawnpoint
EvacZone_MinDistance = 5
EvacZone_MaxDistance = 15
EvacZone_BiasAwayFromXComSpawn = false


; -------- ALERT PHASES
; The Prison Break mission and the Compound Rescue mission hardcodes the Threshold of each alert phase:
; At Threshold 01: 0 [Start of Mission]
; At Threshold 02: 2
; At Threshold 03: 5
; At Threshold 04: 8
; At Threshold 05: 10 [Maximum Alert]
; There are 10 security levels.
;
; The prison break mission changes these rules, so killing ADVENT or getting revealed won't raise the alert by 1, for a maximum of 10.
; Instead, you rack you points by doing hostile and loud actions such as killing, getting spotted, or 
; leaving bodies (for those that use mods that contain abilities that damage enemies but do not reveal).
;
; If you rack up enough points to pass the Alert Threshold, then the Compound will go to the next Phase.
; The formula looks like this: PointsForAction * (Current Security Level + 1). So if you are at Security Level 3 and killed someone, then:
; 10 * 3 = 30 points.
;
; Also, the timer uses a fake number to represent the serverity of the alert (like Metal Gear Solid, but not really).
; 99 is Maximum Alert.
