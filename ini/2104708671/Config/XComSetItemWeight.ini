;	Set Item Weight - Configuration File 
;====================================================================

; This configuration file is split into two sections. 

; Section 1: lets you change the mobility and detection radius bonuses that apply to each weight class.

; Section 2: lets you assign a weight class to:
	; a) a specific weapon/item (e.g. conventional cannon)
	; b) a weapon category (e.g. all cannons)
	; c) an item category (e.g. all vests)

; Available weight classes:
; * MASSIVE
; * HEAVY
; * DENSE
; * MEDIUM
; * LIGHT
; * ULTRALIGHT
; * WEIGHTLESS

; * ABSURD
; * CRAZY
; * RIDIC

; To apply a weight class to:
; 	a) a specific weapon/item
; 		+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(TEMPLATE=Cannon_CV, SET_MASSIVE=1)

;	b) a weapon category
;		+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(WEAPON_CAT=cannon, SET_HEAVY=1)

;	c) an item category
; 		+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(ITEM_CAT=defense, SET_DENSE=1)

; That's it.
; To see a list of item templates, and weapon and item categories check out the ReadMe file. 
; I have a lot of other extensive information in there that you may find useful/interesting. 

; Also, if you're wondring, you can stack these bonuses. So you could do this:
;	 +SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(TEMPLATE=Cannon_CV, SET_MASSIVE=1, SET_HEAVY=1) 
; You therefore cannot override a class.

; Mobility
MASSIVE_ITEM_MOBILITY			= -3		; Default: -3 (slower)

DENSE_ITEM_MOBILITY				= -1		; Default: -1	
MEDIUM_ITEM_MOBILITY			=  0		; Default:  0 (no change)
LIGHT_ITEM_MOBILITY				=  1		; Default:  1
ULTRALIGHT_ITEM_MOBILITY		=  2		; Default:  2
WEIGHTLESS_ITEM_MOBILITY		=  3		; Default:  3 (faster)

; I've opted to make a few extras in case people want them.
ABSURD_ITEM_MOBILITY			= 0
CRAZY_ITEM_MOBILITY				= 0 
RIDIC_ITEM_MOBILITY				= 0

; Detection range
MASSIVE_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS	= -0.3f		; Default: -0.3f (30% easier to be spotted)
HEAVY_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS		= -0.2f		; Default: -0.2f (20%)
DENSE_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS		= -0.1f		; Default: -0.1f (10%)
MEDIUM_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS		=  0.0f		; Default:  0.0f ( 0% = no change)
LIGHT_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS		=  0.1f		; Default:  0.1f (10%)
ULTRALIGHT_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS	=  0.2f		; Default:  0.2f (20%)
WEIGHTLESS_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS	=  0.3f		; Default:  0.3f (30% harder to be spotted)

ABSURD_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS		=  0.0f
CRAZY_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS		=  0.0f
RIDIC_ITEM_DETECTIONRADIUS		=  0.0f

; Note: Medium weight class currently does nothing. 
;		This is a perfect weight class for you to modify yourself! 
;		But feel free to change any and all values. Just make sure you
;		create a backup (I recommend you use the Alternative XCOM 2 
;		Mod Launcher as it has a built-in backup feature).

; Logging
; - By enabling the log Set Item Weight (SIW) will output information
;   regarding what items it has applied a weight class to.
; - You can find the log at under:
;	..\Documents\my games\XCOM2 War of the Chosen\XComGame\Logs\Launch.log
;   Within the log you can search for "SIW" to find its section.
ENABLE_LOG = false


; Make your heavy weapons actually heavy!
; If you're carrying around massive guns, you should be easier to 
; spot, duh. 
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(WEAPON_CAT=cannon,				SET_HEAVY=1)
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(WEAPON_CAT=sniper_rifle,			SET_DENSE=1)
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(WEAPON_CAT=grenade_launcher,		SET_DENSE=1)

; Make the TLE assault rifles heavy versions of the regular assault rifles.
; Do I sense Long War 1 Battle Rifles?*
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(TEMPLATE=TLE_AssaultRifle_CV,	SET_DENSE=1)
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(TEMPLATE=TLE_AssaultRifle_MG,	SET_DENSE=1)
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(TEMPLATE=TLE_AssaultRifle_BM,	SET_DENSE=1)

; Skin Replacer. Look, the stats are staring at you in the face:

; DEW IT.

; Bullpups aren't just a worse version of assault rifles.
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(WEAPON_CAT=bullpup,				SET_LIGHT=1)

; Templars aren't even carrying a gun! Well, a primary at least.
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(WEAPON_CAT=gauntlet,				SET_ULTRALIGHT=1)

; Want more armour? It'll cost you.
; Ok the detection bonus on this one doesn't make as much sense.
; +SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(ITEM_CAT=defense,				SET_DENSE=1)

; That's why you can change "MEDIUM_ITEM_MOBILITY = -1" and then set
+SET_WEIGHT_CLASS=(ITEM_CAT=defense,				SET_MEDIUM=1)

; Don't like any of these changes? Tough!
; Nah, you can delete/change anything you like. 
; You could even delete these snarky comments. But then you'd lose 
; a part of me, and I feel like that would be a little bit sad.
; Don't delete the mod author.





























































; Oh hey what's up. What brings you down here?


























































































; Mate what are you doing.












































































; You just won't leave me alone will you?
