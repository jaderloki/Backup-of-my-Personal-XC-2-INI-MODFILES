; -------- GAMEPLAY
; IntensityMultiplier works like this: 
;
; The higher the intensity, the higher chance that a staff member gets critically wounded or killed, including soldiers.
; This will take into account the current health of the staff member and the rank or a soldier if picked. 
; If a staff member is already wounded and gets chosen again, then he will most certainly die.
