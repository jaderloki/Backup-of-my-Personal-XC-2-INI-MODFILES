[WMO_Subsystems]

; -------- GAMEPLAY
; Don't let the name fool you, this enables different mission behavior for those that support it.
; Most notable examples include:
;		* Completing certain objectives will NOT reveal the squad.
;		* Reinforcements will not drop until a unit is revealed.
;		* AI will not immediately hunt down the unit that is carrying a objective item or object (Stasis Suit, Blacksite Vial) until
;		  either the unit or squad is revealed.
;		* AI will not engage it's hunt system UNLESS squad concealment is broken.
;
; NOTE: If you enable this, you must change MarkingAnyCrateBreaksConcealment to false under [SupplyExtraction]. By default it's set to true.
;		I've already done this below in this ini file. Just remove the semi-colons [;] in front of the plus sign [+]
;

EnableStealthLogicTrack = false

;
; By default, XCom 2 uses a Line of Play system where it takes the centerpoint of your squads current position and try to "intercept" or move towards this centerpoint.
; This only happens when the squad has not broken concealment or before the first pod is encountered if no concealment. 
; Set to false to disable this behavior entirely on all missions. May not work with mods that already disable LOP (Yellow Alert Gameplay).
; WARNING: Disabling LOP will most likely make the game too easy since players can dodge pods almost all the time.

EnableLOPIntercept = true

; -------- EVAC
; NOTE: This does not change Evac completely unless certain mission mods take advantage of the subsystem in this mod. 
;       If you want BHR rules for all missions, see Boundir's Request Evac mod found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1823265096
;
; Formula: Rand(2,4) + 2. 1 to 3 if we don't count the current turn.
;
; That determines the number of turns that it takes before EVAC arrives. 
; After 3 turns has passed after Evac has arrived, the Skyranger will depart. Cooldown is applied on the ability.
;
; If disabled, uses normal EVAC rules.

EnableBeaglerushHouseRulesOnEVAC = true

; -------- UI
;
; If set to true, popups will show in all missions to brief you on the current mission objective or if the mission changes. 
;

EnableTutorialPopups = true


[GP_BlackSite]

; New feature of WMO. Disables the cinematics in Blacksite if set to false.
; If Zip mode is enabled in the Options, then by default will skip all cutscenes.
; If Zip mode is disabled, then you can disable certain cutscenes (Reveal, Statis Tube Reveal, Vial Grab) by setting them to true.
;

SkipBlacksiteReveal = false

SkipStasisTubeReveal = false

SkipVialGrabCutscene = false
