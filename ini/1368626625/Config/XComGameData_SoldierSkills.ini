;normally, the way XCOM works is that if a unit goes into a mission when Ready, they can only become Tired (and thus be subject to additional negative trait checks and panic checks) after the mission is done
; or Shaken, if the will damage on a mission goes that bad
; with the psyker gauntlets, however, we can change that
;by default, the gauntlets will make the unit count as Tired as soon as they meet the requirements for them in the mission
