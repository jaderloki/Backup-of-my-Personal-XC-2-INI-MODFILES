[XComGame.X2Ability_SkirmisherAbilitySet]
BATTLELORD_ACTIONS=0 ; Fixes a bug where Battlelord would only activate for one enemy each turn
; 0 means infinite enemies, above 0 is the number of enemies Battlelord should activate on

[CooldownSkirmisher.X2AbilityCooldown_Grapple]
GRAPPLE_COOLDOWN=3 ; Base cooldown of the Skirmisher's grapple
PARKOUR_COOLDOWN_REDUCTION=1 ; Turns of cooldown that are subtracted if the Skrimisher has Parkour

; NOTE: changing the above does NOT change the game's text,
; so the GTS perk will still say that it only reduces the cooldown by 1,
; and the Grapple ability will still say its cooldown is 3,
; no matter what config settings you put.
