; THIS VALUE IS A DELAY BEFORE TRYING TO UPDATE THE SQUAD MANAGER PANEL ON SQUAD SELECT
; IF YOU FIND IT NOT CORRECTLY UPDATING ITS POSITION, TRY INCREASING THIS
; THIS IS REQUIRED BECAUSE THE SQUAD MANAGER PANEL APPEARING HAS IT'S OWN DELAY IN LW CONFIGS
; BASICALLY THIS SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN XCOMLW_OVERHAUL.INI'S [SquadInfo_DelayedInit], WHICH IS 0.75 BY DEFAULT
; SO THE DEFAULT HERE IS 1.2 WHICH SHOULD BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR THE PANEL TO BE CREATED ...... ...... 
DelaySMUpdate = 1.2

; THIS IS THE COLOURS EACH TEAMS ICONS WILL USE
