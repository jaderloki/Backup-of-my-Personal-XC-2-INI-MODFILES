;	EXPLANATION
;==========================================================================================

; I strongly advise numbers to be the same for each shot, but you can set them however you want
; All special shots still require the Heavy Cannon to have 1 ammo and consume 1 ammo
; All special shots still use <Heavy Cannon Default Action Points> to fire ... 2AP

;	CHARGES
; EQUIPPING  A WEAPON RACK WILL OVERIDE THE SOLO VALUE
; IF EITHER IS SET HIGHER THAN 1, HARDCAPPED TO A MINIMUM OF 1 CHARGE ON BOTH
; SO YOU CANT HAVE 1CHARGE RACKED AND UNLIMITED SOLO FOR EXAMPLE 
; !! SET BOTH VALUES TO ZERO TO NEGATE ADDING CHARGES !!

; how many charges of the special shot should you have for equipping a solo shell
; this is the infinite ammo style item
;	iSoloCharges = X

; how many charges of the special shot should you have for equipping a weapon rack
; the weapon rack allows you to use ALL 3 special shots, its very powerful
;	iRackCharges = X

;	COOLDOWN
; how many turns cooldown until the special shot can be used again
; a value of 1 is no double special shots in a singular turn
; a value of 0 will skip adding cooldowns at all
;	iCooldown = X
