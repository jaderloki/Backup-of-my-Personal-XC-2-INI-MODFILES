; Mod default is 0 AP
DROP_ACTION_POINTS   = 0; 0-2. Actions required for ability to be available to use, but not necessarily it's cost if you flag TOTALLY_FREE on. But it is usually its cost.
PICKUP_ACTION_POINTS = 0;
SUBDUE_ACTION_POINTS = 0;

; Mod default does not end the turn (False).
DROP_ENDS_TURN       = false; True or false, default in this mod is false. Put to true to end the turn like regular XCOM. We dont want the turn to end.
PICKUP_ENDS_TURN     = false;
SUBDUE_ENDS_TURN     = false;

; Mod default is the ability does not cost it's required AP. (true)
DROP_TOTALLY_FREE    = true; AP will be required if specified, but will not be consumed. 0 AP and TOTALLY FREE behaves like EVAC and is available after a soldier has nothing left to do.
PICKUP_TOTALLY_FREE  = true; 
SUBDUE_TOTALLY_FREE  = true;

SUBDUE_BREAKS_CONCEALMENT = false; This is personal preference. False makes it possible to have perfect concealment missions from A to Z, true makes it the aliens activate once you get to the VIP.

; Example
; AP 0 / Ends turn No / Totally Free yes behaves like EVAC. It's always there and you can spam it over and over until you force the end of turn.
; AP 1 / Ends turn No / Totally Free makes it usable infinitely until your soldier has no Actions left from something else like move/fire.
; AP 1 / Ends turn No / Not totally free makes it usable once per action the soldier has until he has none left.
; AP 0 / Ends turn No / Not totally free makes it the same as totally free because it costs 0 AP.
; Any combination with End Turn Yes means any use ends the turn like firing.
; AP 2 would need the soldier to be in a full fresh turn or have extra AP to use after moving for example.
