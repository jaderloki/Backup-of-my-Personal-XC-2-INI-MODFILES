;formula for heat after actions
;(base did a thing heat + story/facility bonus + # of aliens killed + chosen appeared * [squad size taken on mission / max squad size ])
; base value differs on whether it was a mission or covert action
; covert actions in regions with medium heat or worse have a chance of soldiers coming back with negative traits

; current status:
; you should get one to two missions with zero heat
; low heat should the default for the early game: it should naturally ramp up once you start taking on missions with more people available
; once you're in medium heat you experience mildly increasd forces in terms of advancedness (regular advanced can be used from a mod)

TierOneHeat=63f; kicks in once you do a mission in a region or multiple covert actions: this is "normal"
TierTwoHeat=313f; provides medium heat penalties
TierThreeHeat=616f; provides maximum heat penalties + starts command raid mission
TierFourHeat=1000f; does nothing for the moment.

MaxHeatMissionLimit = eLSC_HeatMAX; high, medium, low, or None can go in the place of max

; positive is bad, negative is good for the below values
CovertActionBase = 10f;
FailedMissionBase = 10f;  for covetr action ambushes, the above value gets substracted from this or success depending on mission outcome: by default this means failed ambushes cost nothing in terms of heat, and successful ones should be 15 instead of 25
SuccessfulMissionBase = 25f;
StoryMalus = 25f; covert actions for the chosen count too
FacilityMalus = 10f; covert actions for the avatar project count too

AliensKilledMalus = 1f; only counting enemies on eTeam_Alien, not eTeam_TheLost
ChosenMalus = -5f; decreasing heat a bit if the chosen appear

;decay rate per day
HeatDecayRate=0.5f

; maluses
NegativeTraitChance = 20; chance of earning a negative trait when a covert action completes in a med heat area
HighHeatNegativeTraitMalus = 20; // add to the above if operating in an area at max heat

HeatSuppliesLoss = 0.05f; // lose this much supplies when a continent heat hits medium. 0.05f at first...
HighHeatSuppliesMalus = 0.05f; // then lose a bit more at max heat

; this will be expanded on later on

; DLC HOOKS
RulerAppearedHeat = -5f; // lose a bit of heat if an alien ruler appeared on a mission


; adviser variables
ScientistDecayRateBonus=0.15 ;extra decay
ScientistIntelBonus=10 ;bonus intel gained from completing scans in continent

EngineerRadioRebatebonus=0.25f ;rebate to building radios in the continent
EngineerSupplydropBonus=0.05f; bonus supplies when you recover supply drops: effect stacks per continent (so you get 30% bonus supplies if all continents have engineers)

SoldierNoRadioTurnBonus=1; one extra turn on timer missions in continent
SoldierNoRadioTurnBonusExperienced=2; one extra turn on timer missions in continent
SoldierNoRadioTurnBonusMaster=3; one extra turn on timer missions in continent

;continent bonus benefits are now civilians in the continent being XCOM friendly, and the emergency override ability being granted to the commander
