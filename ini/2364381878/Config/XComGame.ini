;bAllowSS is a boolean for if the SquadSize GTS purchases ... SS Upgrades I, II, (III and IV) ... should be applied to the squad size if purchased
;bAllowSS will also add 2 if the CovertInfiltration mod is detected, as CI lacks normal SS Upgrades.
;no extra config is needed for this to work with RJSS

;so with the above setup xcom will need a larger spawn point, normally they have a 3x3 area or 9 tiles, 
;USING CHL DLC HOOK INSTEAD, THIS AIMS TO AUTO-SIZE THE SPAWN AREA BASED ON NUMBER OF SQUAD MEMBERS
bUseSpawnSizeOverride_Rusty = true

; if you don't wish to use my spawn point override that I copied from LW code then you should at least use the CHL helper for increasing spawn size, or a mod that does so
;we need an area that can take our maximum, the below codes adds to the area
;in the CHL code this is calculated as a 2+x value ...
;adding 1 to the default gives us a 4x4 spawn area, or 16 tiles which isn't enough
;adding 2 to the default gives us a 5x5 spawn area, or 25 tiles ... 
;Uncomment the below two lines to increase default spawn size for XCOM using CHL backup code

;I want this to run after all other mods have done stuff to the squadsize
