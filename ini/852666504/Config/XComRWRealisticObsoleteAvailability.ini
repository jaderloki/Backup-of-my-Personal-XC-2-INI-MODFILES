[RWRealisticObsoleteAvailability.RWRealisticObsoleteAvailability]
;My old Tier Medikit and Smoke/Emp Grenades (and other Mods' old Tier non-infinite items) remain available to build (usefully because cheaper) after completion of the next Tierâ€™s research which gives one new Tier item instead of upgrading every old Tier item (unrealistically always for the same cost no matter the amount), yours?


;Now such Upgrade Researches will simply make availabe Construction of Tier 2 of Medikit, Smoke Gr., Emp Gr. and other Non-Infinite, Buildable, Upgradable Mod-Items. BUT:
;1. Leaving Tier 1 still available for construction (except Experimental Gr.)
;2. Not upgrading even a single one of your Tier 1 Items (yes, you heard it)
;3. Giving you 1 Item of the new Tier (except for Experimental Gr.)


;EMP GRENADES/BOMBS?
;Stupidly they seem to have the same cost of 50 Supplies instead of a different one as in Medikits... so, now that you can have both available once Bombs have been researched, I decided to decrease/increase their costs of the same value  (or the value you choose in the .ini file)

(You can change to the desired value in the .ini file)
EMPGrenadeTiersHaveAPriceDifferenceOf = 20

;PERSONALLY I like a Price-Difference similar to the Tier I/II Medikit:
;EMP Grenades: 40 Supplies
;EMP Bombs:	   60 Supplies
;This also changes the Black Market Cost proportionally ;)


;CLASS OVERRIDES:
;Not a single one
