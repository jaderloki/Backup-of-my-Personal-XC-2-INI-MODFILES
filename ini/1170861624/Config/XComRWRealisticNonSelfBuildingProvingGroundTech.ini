[RWRealisticNonSelfBuildingProvingGroundTech.RWRealisticNonSelfBuildingProvingGroundTech]
;My Proving Ground Technologies don't magically "build themselves up" when no Engineer is assigned but instead their construction realistically doesn't progress (exactly like for Rooms' Debris-Clearings) and, as a consequence, my Proving Ground has a second Engineer-Slot (also exactly like for Rooms' Debris-Clearings) to reduce Construction Time by 50% (and, to compensate the extra work, from the beginning of the Campaign Shen counts as an extra assignable Engineer), yours?

;BUILDING PROVING GROUND TECH WITHOUT THIS MINI-MOD
;0 Engineers --> Building
;1 Engineer  --> 50% Time Reduction

;BUILDING PROVING GROUND TECH WITH THIS MINI-MOD (EXACTLY LIKE FOR CLEARING ROOM-DEBRIS)
;0 Engineers --> Paused
;1 Engineer  --> Building
;2 Engineers --> 50% Time Reduction

;I COULDN'T STAND IT
;I know that there is other Crew in the Avenger besides Engineers, Scientists and Soldiers (the ones with gray suit) but, as a mechanical engineer myself, I simply can't stand the fact that advanced technology could be entirely built without (at least the constant supervision of) a single Engineer... but apart from that, why Rooms Debris-Clearings need at least an assigned Engineer to progress while Proving Ground Projects don't??? I couldn't stand the incoherence... I simply couldn't continue my first campaign until I modded this inconsistence out of existence once and for all... ;)

;DIFFICULTY BALANCE
;To preserve the difficulty balance originally intended by Firaxis this disadvantage of Proving Ground Techs not progressing anymore without at least one assigned Engineer had to be compensated somehow. It felt not only an appropriate balance but also an elegantly realistic one to let Shen be an extra assignable Engineer from the beginning of the Campaign (what the hell was she doing standing there like an idiot all day?).  

;SAME FOR BUILDING FACILITIES?
;If you want the same dynamics for that you can do it with my other Mini-Mod "RW Realistic Non Self Building Facilities"... ;)  I was originally planning to move both these modifications into a single Mini-Mod during the "mutilation" process of my RW Mega-Mod but then said... naah, what the heck, let's cut it into 2 separate Mini-Mods...

;CLASS OVERRIDES
;Not a single one... ;)
