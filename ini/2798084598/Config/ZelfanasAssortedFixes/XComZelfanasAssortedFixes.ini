; This config file can be dauntingly long but that's a small price to pay for modularity.

; Merge duplicate action point costs on all abilities. This is done in a smart way by keeping the "highest" cost as the
;   final result. The game doesn't expect abilities having multiple AP costs and doesn't handle them correctly so
;   abilities shouldn't have more than one action point cost and it is usually in error if they do.
; Free and non-free costs are handled separately as there are valid use cases for that (eg. require 2 points but use 1).

; Change ability action point costs. This is very simplified and mostly useful to change turn-ending behaviour.
;   Typical weapon costs will be kept as well as point amounts. If you change a free action's cost with this it will

; Fix abilities double dipping on damage due to having a set damage value without enabling bIgnoreBaseDamage which
;   causes them to apply an assigned weapon's base damage in addition to the ability's own damage.
; Usually this is not a problem as these abilities are not normally assigned to weapons but some mods do assign them and
;   this causes them to do much more damage than intended.
FixDoubleDippingDamage = true

+DoubleDippingAbilities = Whiplash

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Fix abilities not being tagged as bMeleeAttack. This makes them not count for Sectoid melee vulnerability because that
;   checks this flag as well as the damage type being melee. Normally the flag just makes the hit calc not use cover and
;   flanking crit bonus.
FixMeleeAttackHitCalc = true

; Ragestrike is guaranteed hit without critical damage so changing this flag shouldn't affect it other than making it hurt Sectoids more
+ConvertToMeleeAbilities = Ragestrike

; Fix super concealment (Shadow) not having a minimum detection distance on most soldier classes. In base game this is
;   obviously not a problem because only Reapers have Shadow but mods can add it to other classes and if they don't set
;   this MinSuperConcealedDistance on those classes then they can go down to zero detection radius and become invisible
;   to enemies. This is not desired behavior most of the time.
FixShadowDetection = true

; Default value on Reaper class, will set classes to this value if they don't have a value yet
MinSuperConcealedDistance=2.5f

; Fix Icarus Jump and all other abilities using the same TargetingMethod X2TargetingMethod_DLC_2IcarusJump not requiring
;   vertical clearance to use even though the target location still needs vertical clearance.
; They will still be usable in sewers and other "indoor" maps, this new condition just adds the exact same limitation to
;   the source location that it already has for the target location.
FixIcarusJumpingIndoors = true

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Fix weapon upgrades being excluded only one way. The game doesn't check exclusions both ways so they have to be done
;   both ways manually. This will go through all weapon upgrade templates to check for MutuallyExclusiveUpgrades and
;   check each of those weapon upgrades for exclusion of the other weapon upgrade.
; This is usually a cross-mod compat issue.
FixWeaponUpgradeExclusions = true

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Fix Holy Warrior effects not getting removed if the source unit gets removed from play by evac or other means.
;   This is achieved by adding the PriestRemoved ability to all abilities that have an effect with the name "HolyWarriorEffect".
;   PriestRemoved was already on Priests in multiplayer but not in single player for whatever reason.
; Will also enable bUniqueSource on PriestRemoved just in case it actually is given to the unit from elsewhere as well.
; Units with Holy Warrior that are able to evac include MOCX Psi Agents, Priests from Double Agent and modded soldiers.
