; Put an ability name in the Template field that you want to mess with. It does not discriminate based on things like character template or class.
; If you want to add new prerequisites, put those in the PreReqs field(s). Or, you can skip that step entirely if you just want no prerequisites for that ability.
; Maybe don't do stupid shit like removing Schism's prerequisite.

; Examples of proper use:
; +Edits=(Template="NullLance") <---- will make Null Lance have no prerequisites
; +Edits=(Template="NullLance", PreReqs[0]="Fuse") <---- will make Null Lance have Fuse as a prerequisite
; +Edits=(Template="NullLance", PreReqs[0]="Fuse", PreReqs[1]="Solace_LW") <---- will make Null Lance have Fuse AND the LWOTC version of Solace as a prerequisite
