; ----- NEW -----			Alex Nares: Adding explanation of these parameters:

+NormalSquadSize=6				; XCOM squad size at which to begin aim assist bonuses when number of active XCOM units drops below this number. (Counts friendly VIPs or Civilians under XCOM's control)
+ReasonableShotMinimumToEnableAimAssist=50	; Minimum Hit % required when taking a shot, before Aim Assist can kick in. (keeps players from "gaming" the system off weak shots)
+MaxAimAssistScore=100				; Aim Assist bonuses will not push Hit% higher than this.

; Rookie
+BaseXComHitChanceModifier=1.0			; All XCOM shots Hit % secretly multipled by this number.
+MissStreakChanceAdjustment=0			; After XCOM misses a shot, XCOM's next shot gains this Hit % (this turn only).
+HitStreakChanceAdjustment=-20			; When enemies hit XCOM with a shot, enemies' next shot loses this amount (this turn only).
+SoldiersLostXComHitChanceAdjustment=15		; If the number of active XCOM units in play is below "NormalSquadSize", XCOM units gain this much AIM for each missing unit. (Counts friendly VIPs or Civilians under XCOM's control)
+SoldiersLostAlienHitChanceAdjustment=-10	; If the number of active XCOM units in play is below "NormalSquadSize", enemies lose this much AIM for each missing XCOM unit. (Counts friendly VIPs or Civilians under XCOM's control)
+AlienVsTheLostHitChanceAdjustment=0		; Doesn't seem to work, but I think it was supposed to affect shots made from Aliens against the Lost. Maybe cut content.
+TheLostVsAlienHitChanceAdjustment=0		; Doesn't seem to work, but I think it was supposed to affect attacks made from The Lost against Aliens. Maybe cut content.
