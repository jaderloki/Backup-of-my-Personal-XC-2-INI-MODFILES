;----------------------------------
; TacticalGameEnd
;----------------------------------

; These options apply to alive units on mission end.
; Normal looting rules apply; you have to win the mission with kill objective or evac the units to recover their loot.


; Loot mind controlled / hacked enemies alive on your team.
; This is basically what Loot Mind Control was supposed to do but didn't.

LootMindControlMissionEnd = true


; Recover loot picked up by player controlled units that are not your own soldiers
;   (Double Agent/Volunteer Army/other mission provided units).
; Normally you would have to get them killed intentionally for the loot to be recoverable.

LootAlliedUnits = true


; Make alive but incapacitated (bleeding out or unconscious) enemies on the enemy team drop loot.
; Kill objective does not require these to be killed so battle can end with them still alive and thus not looted.

LootIncapacitatedEnemies = true


; Make alive turrets on the enemy team drop loot.
; Turrets are not required for kill objectives so if you kill all other enemies first you can miss out on turret loot.

LootAliveTurrets = true


;----------------------------------
; UnitDied
;----------------------------------

; Loot mind controlled / hacked enemies dying while still under your control. Units on the XCom team do not normally
;   drop any kind of loot except picked up loot they were carrying.

LootMindControlDeaths = true


;----------------------------------
; MindControlled
;----------------------------------

; Make mind controlling / hacking an enemy instantly drop their timed loot and carried loot (if they have any).
; Corpses and other loot will still only drop on death (or mission end with LootMindControlMissionEnd).

;InstantLootMindControl = true


;----------------------------------
; UnitUnconscious
;----------------------------------

; Make knocking an enemy unconscious instantly drop their timed loot and carried loot (if they have any).
; Corpses and other loot will still only drop on death (or mission end with LootIncapacitatedEnemies).

InstantLootUnconscious = true


;----------------------------------
; General options
;----------------------------------

; These are checked in addition to other options when applicable.


; Bypass effects that prevent looting for carried loot and timed loot drops. These effects are typically used to prevent
;   duplicate corpse loot like multiple Codex Brains dropping from one Codex that cloned itself. Backpack and timed loot
;   do not suffer from these duplication problems so it makes sense for them to bypass the effects.

BypassEffectsForTimedLoot = true


; Drop picked up loot (backpack contents) for units not on the XCom team. This will create a loot drop in the same way
;   timed loot does. Situations where this can happen include enemy units picking up loot and XCom soldiers carrying
;   loot dying while being mind controlled.

LootEnemyBackpacks = true


;----------------------------------
; Config lists
;----------------------------------

; Override loot to be dropped when collecting loot from alive enemy units on mission ending.
; This special handling is required for Andromedons and other such units that transform into different units when they die.
; Note: Frost Legion Andromedon does not convert to robot and drops loot directly so does not need to be included here.

;   effects such as Chryssalid Poison can prevent their corpses dropping.
; Codex clones will not drop multiple Codex Brains, that is handled separately.
; This list is used for both mission end and unit death loot.
