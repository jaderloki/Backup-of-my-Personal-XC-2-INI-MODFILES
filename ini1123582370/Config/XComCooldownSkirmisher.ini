BATTLELORD_COOLDOWN = 5
;Keep in mind the numbers are ENEMY turns until next use, not PLAYER turns. So a 3-turn cooldown looks like this:
; Use ability - enemy turn - your turn - enemy turn - your turn - enemy turn - use ability again
; You can also adjust the action point costs for Whiplash and Battlelord here.
; But you cannot adjust Interrupt, because getting to use actions after going on overwatch is dumb
