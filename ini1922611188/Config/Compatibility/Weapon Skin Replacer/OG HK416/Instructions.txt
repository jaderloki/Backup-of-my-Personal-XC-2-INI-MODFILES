NOTE: You must use Iridar's Weapon Skin Replacer to change the default attachments of the HK416D!

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you copy this mod into your local mod directory, or else this will get overwritten and you will have to redo the process again!

To get the OG HK 416 with proper upgrades:

1) Go to the root folder of this mod, where you can see the following folders and files: 
	./Config
	./Content
	./Localization
	./Src
	Readme.txt

2) Unzip the file somewhere and drag the folder called Config into the root directory

3) When asked, override all of the files.

If you do override those files, then it should work. If you don't get such prompt, then something went wrong.
