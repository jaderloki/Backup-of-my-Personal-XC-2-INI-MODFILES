;disabled by default as the shard gauntlets have 'issues' with animations and actually giving some abilities
;setting this false will mean shard gauntlets can accept melee attachments, but not GEMs, and need another 3rd party mod for slots
;setting this true will mean that shard gauntlets can accept GEMs, but not melee attachments, and get 'CV tier' slots (2/2/2)
;They do not get the free starting perk as they have Rend.
;Will also give slots to and allow GEM's for Altered Rushano's Caster Gauntlets, these are the same weapon category, so have to enabled/disabled at the same time
